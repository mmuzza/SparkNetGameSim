Good solution. I would've liked to see you use .conf files for all the variables since these are easy points that you should be getting with all the work you've put in. I also do not see a video submission from you on Github or Teams, which is another aspect that you can look into for the third homework, since after reading your documentation, you have a general idea of what to do.
Good job overall!
